# Leyman

An Nx monorepo for various libraries and plugins.

It is _highly_ recommended when developing locally to use a devcontainer. This will ensure your environment is set up correctly, and not risk interfering with any other settings or packages you may have configured across your desktop.

The [.devcontainer](./.devcontainer) directory is fully set up. If you open this repo in VSCode, you should immediately see an option to open it up in DevContainer.

See individual packages for documentation.
